I'll probably eventually make a level editor if I get motivated enough
But it's not too hard to edit with a text editor. Just some things you need to know:


1) Level size MUST be 29 lines long and MUST be 28 columns wide, separated by spaces.
	(So file dimensions are 29 x 56, with one exception [see #2])

2) The last line of the file (line 30) is a single number, 1 through 9 specifying
	the difficulty. the higher the number, the less time invincibility lasts.

3) The map is composed of integers. Therefore, any blank spaces in the map should
	be replaced with 0. 

4) Each item in Pacman is represented by a number, 0 through 9
	0 = Blank space		5 = Blinky
	1 = Wall		6 = Inkey
	2 = Pellet		7 = Clyde
	3 = Power Up		8 = Pinky
	4 = Spawning wall	9 = Pacman

5) The spawning wall is a wall that the ghosts can go through but Pacman cannot.
	These can be used to make levels REALLY difficult. Check level 09

6) Borders shouldn't need to be used, but give it a more Pacman-like feel.
	If a ghost or Pacman are able to reach the very end of the border,
	he they will be teleported to the opposite side of the level, both X and Y
	just like in the regular game.

7) See any included level__.dat file for examples.


To load a custom level, run pacman with the level file as the parameter:

:$ pacman levelfile.dat
